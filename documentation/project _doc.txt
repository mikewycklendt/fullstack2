PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

All good, well-documented projects have a README.md file that should clearly explain 
the project and how to get started with it to any developers who may want to use or 
contribute to the project. Depending on your personal style preferences and project 
type, the structure and exact contents will differ, but the structure below is a good 
starting place.
