Good API documentation
Good API documentation allows any developer considering the API to quickly understand 
the purpose of the API, the data it works with, and how to send requests and parse the 
responses. Some documentation, particularly for large projects, even host samples you 
can run within the documentation to see the API in action. For the purposes of this 
course, you don't need to implement interactivity, but you will provide examples that 
can be run by someone viewing your documentation.

Here's a recap (for your reference) of the components that are typically included in 
good API documentation:

	Base URL
	API Keys /Authentication (if applicable)
Errors
	Response codes
	Messages
